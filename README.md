Developer Matchmaker Project

## Overview

This app serves as a tool for developers to connect to other people with similar skills, tech-stacks, and interests. The app can be used to find a teammate, employee/employer, mentee/mentor, or just someone to chat with about a tech-related subject.

The design will resemble a dating application or social media website. Individuals create a profile and are matched with others based on a number of filters. People can reach out to each other and chat in real time, and then rate the other user based on the interaction.

## Features

- Profile includes image, username, tech stack, interests, time zone, spoken language, available hours.
- List of matches can be filtered by tech stack, geography, spoken language, available hours. The initial list of matches displayed is based on the user's chosen tech stack, personal preferences, and other profile parameters.
- From the dashboard, users can access Matched Profiles, Your Profile (the userâ€™s unique profile), and Settings.
- Users can seek matches for multiple projects.
- Users will have a maximum of (?) active projects.
- Projects can be active, on hold, completed.
